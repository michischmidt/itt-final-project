## Things need to be done
* [ ] Implement data extraction for all dippid sensors? (not sure if gravity needed)
* [ ] Implement classifier (not sure if svm is best for this usecase)
* [ ] Save classifiers so they dont need be trained by user
* [ ] Add audio for every component on hit

## Nice to have: 
* [ ] Save generated drum solos as mp3? or any other form
* [ ] GUI with every component which lights up on hit
* [ ] Change volume based on how "hard" the hit was
* [ ] Allow to dippid devices to play (lol wie viel arbeit des w√§re)

Fragen:
- Ob des Thema klar geht
- Classifier rumprobieren?
- Gravity?
